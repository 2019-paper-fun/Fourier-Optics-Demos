## Fourier Optics Demos and Tutorials
Written by Kristina Monakhova

This is a compilation of Fourier optics demos and tutorials in Jupyter
Notebooks.

#### Digital Holography
Digital refocusing of amplitude targets using Fresnel
propagator.  Two modes:
 * simulated: propagates complex field by a desired distance
 * experimental: takes in defocused image from microscope and propagates to
 digitally refocus the image

#### Digital Holography Quantitative Phase (coming soon)
Takes in a defocused image stack and solves
for the phase of the object using Gerchberg-Saxton.
