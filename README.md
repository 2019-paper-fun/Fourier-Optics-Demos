Fourier Optics Demos and Tutorials in Jupyter Notebooks

Written by Kristina Monakhova

This is a compilation of Fourier optics demos and tutorials in Jupyter
Notebooks.

* Digital Holography - digital refocusing of amplitude targets using Fresnel
propagator.  Two modes:
 - simulated: propagates complex field by a desired distance
 - experimental: takes in defocused image from microscope and propagates to
 digitally refocus the image
* Quantitative Phase (coming soon) - takes in a defocused image stack and solves
for the phase of the object using Gerchberg-Saxton.
