# Fourier Optics Demos and Tutorials
Written by Kristina Monakhova, Dec. 2017
These demos are intended to be a gentle introduction to several fundamental Fourier optics concepts/techniques.  These tutorials draw heavily upon Matlab code from [Laura Waller's Open Source Matlab Code](http://www.laurawaller.com/opensource/).

*More tutorials coming soon!*

## Tutorials
### 1. Digital Holography ([Notebook](https://github.com/monakhova/Fourier-Optics-Demos/blob/master/Digital%20Holographic%20Refocusing/Digital_Refocus.ipynb))
  Digital refocusing of amplitude targets using Fresnel propagator.  Two modes:
  * simulated: propagates complex field by a desired distance
  * experimental: takes in defocused image from microscope and propagates to digitally refocus the image

### 2. Quantitative Phase from defocus ([Notebook](https://github.com/monakhova/Fourier-Optics-Demos/blob/master/Quantitative%20Phase%20from%20Defocus/Phase_from_Defocus.ipynb))
  Takes in a defocused image stack and solves for the phase of the object using Gerchberg-Saxton.
