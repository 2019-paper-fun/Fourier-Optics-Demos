# Fourier Optics Demos and Tutorials
Hi! This is a compilation of Fourier Optics demos and tutorials that I've put
together in Jupyter Notebooks. This is intended to be a simple introduction to
several fundamental Fourier optics concepts and techniques.  These Jupyter
Notebooks were put together by Kristina Monakhova, but draw heavily upon
Matlab code from [Laura Waller's Open Source Matlab Code](http://www.laurawaller.com/opensource/)

## Tutorials
### 1. Digital Holography ([Notebook](https://github.com/monakhova/Fourier-Optics-Demos/blob/master/Digital%20Holography/Digital%20Refocus.ipynb))
  Digital refocusing of amplitude targets using Fresnel propagator.  Two modes:
  * simulated: propagates complex field by a desired distance
  * experimental: takes in defocused image from microscope and propagates to digitally refocus the image

### 2. Quantitative Phase from defocus (coming soon)
  Takes in a defocused image stack and solves for the phase of the object using Gerchberg-Saxton.
